# Introduction

Different people have varied opinions about the coronavirus on Twitter. Some are overly anxious about the impact of the virus while others are overly optimistic. We wanted to explore how different people react to the same news by analyzing the sentiments of their tweets. We focused on the groups of people who have significant impacts on the public opinion, namely celebrities (top 100 accounts), medical associations, politicians, news media agencies.
