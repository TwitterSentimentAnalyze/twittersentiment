[["index.html", "Twitter Sentiment Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Twitter Sentiment Analysis Sung Jun Won(sw3049), Elin Kim(hk3175), Alex Kita(ak4729) 2021-12-12 Chapter 1 Introduction People have varied opinions about the COVID-19, and many have expressed their thoughts regarding COVID-19 on Twitter. Some are overly anxious about the impact of the virus while others are optimistic. We wanted to explore how some influential groups of people/organizations - namely celebrities, medical associations, and politicians - reacted to COVID-19 from the beginning of COVID-19 crisis in March 2020 up to the current date. We mainly focused on analyzing sentiments of the tweets related to COVID-19 to learn how the reactions to COVID-19 were different or similar between the groups as well as within the groups. We laid out our sentiment analysis project in a number of steps. We start by introducing how we collected the Twitter data using Twitter API, followed by how we cleaned and transformed the data to fit the purpose of our project. Then we explain and graphically show how we dealt with missing values. The next part, which we think is the major part of the project, shows various graphs that explains trends of sentiment changes over time between the groups and within the groups. We also implemented the interactive graph that allows the user to choose which group’s sentiment score changes over time to display. The last part of the project discusses what we have learned in the process and what we can potentially do to develop the sentiment analysis further. book URL: https://twittersentimentanalyze.github.io/twittersentiment/ This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/EDAVtemplate "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our dataset consists of tweets data collected by rtweet Twitter API. We mainly collected tweets for three groups of people/organizations: politicians, medical associations, and celebrities. For each group, we chose top 10 most-followed twitter accounts and extracted 10,000 most recent tweets of each user within time range 2020-03-12 23:00:56 ~ 2021-11-28 17:30:42. For the users that have less than 10,000 tweets during that time, all their tweets in the time range are collected. All three of the team members contributed to collecting data. Alex investigated how to use Twitter API to fetch tweets data and collected tweets of top 5 most-followed politicians from both democratic and republic parties (Ref: https://socialblade.com/twitter/top/100, https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/lifestyle/magazine/amp-stories/twitter/, and https://viralpitch.co/topinfluencers/twitter/top-200-twitter-influencers/). Elin collected top 10 celebrities list ranked by the number of followers (Ref: https://socialblade.com/twitter/top/100), and Kevin found top 100 most-followed medical Twitter accounts. (Ref: https://emedcert.com/blog/top-healthcare-twitter-accounts-to-follow) The main hardship we faced was that there was no API that provides most-followed twitter accounts for specific group. We had to manually look for twitter accounts in politics, medical field, and celebrities from Twitter Statistics websites such as SocialBlade and list out the top 10 most-followed accounts for each group. For medical associations, we had to narrow down top 100 most followed medical twitter accounts by number of followers provided by rtweet::get_timelines. Also, it is noteworthy that for the top 10 politicians, the number of followers for 5 Republicans vs. the number of followers for 5 Democrats have a huge gap. Though democrats have 4~10 times more followers than the republicans, we think that this does not influence our analysis on sentiment score because the number of followers has no big correlation to the tweets’ sentiments. In addition, there are numerous unnecessary or insignificant features in the dataset collected, so we performed data cleaning in the following chapter (3 Data Transformation) For politicians, we have ‘BarackObama’, ‘JoeBiden’, ‘HillaryClinton’, ‘KamalaHarris’, ‘AOC’, ‘Mike_Pence’, ‘tedcruz’, ‘marcorubio’, ‘randpaul’, ‘MittRomney’. For medical associations, we narrowed the top 100 most-followed accounts down to 10: ‘NYTHealth’, ‘ClevelandClinic’, ‘CDCemergency’, ‘MayoClinic’, ‘drsanjaygupta’, ‘HarvardHealth’, ‘WebMD’, ‘CDCgov’, ‘RedCross’, ‘WHO’. For celebrities, we have ‘justinbieber’, ‘katyperry’, ‘rihanna’, ‘taylorswift13’, ‘arianagrande’, ‘ladygaga’, ‘TheEllenShow’, ‘KimKardashian’, ‘selenagomez’, ‘elonmusk’. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Functions for data cleaning 3.2 Combining all three groups with indicator column", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Functions for data cleaning For cleaning the data, we mainly used two functions: clean_tweets and tagging. clean_tweets function removes the parts of the tweets that are not relevant to sentiment analysis. For instance, we removed URLs, @username, special characters, newlines, and whitespaces to have the texts ready for analysis. tagging function selects the tweets that have at least one of the tags related to COVID-19. For instance, a tweet with “corona” or “covid-19” would be kept for analysis, while a tweet that has none of the tags in the list would be excluded. We used these two functions on all our dataset for three groups to work with only cleaned tweets related to COVID-19, and saved the dataset in three separate csv files, one for politicians, one for medical associations, and one for celebrities. 3.2 Combining all three groups with indicator column We then combined the three groups’ dataset into a single dataframe and added a group indicator column. We saved that combined dataframe in data_combined_filtered.csv. By doing so, we can access the entire data from a single csv file for all the subsequent parts. After doing so, we made new columns to the dataframe: “joy”, “trust”, “anticipation”, “sadness”, “fear”, “anger”, “surprise”, “disgust”, “positive”, “negative”, “sentiment_score”. Each column except for “sentiment_score” contains the number of words in each tweet pertaining to that sentiment. By making these columns, we can see numerically, for instance, what was the dominating sentiment in a tweet or how each group reacted to COVID-19 in certain period of time. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Here is the missing value plot function we defined in Problem Set 4. It is hard to draw any significant conclusion from columns that have more than 90% of entries with missing values. Thus, we decided to remove all columns that have NA in more than 90% of entries. As a matter of fact, “quote_count” and “reply_count” columns have 100% of the entries with NA, so they are removed from the dataframe. Also, there are 33 rows that have NA for text, which is the tweet. We can’t perform any sentiment analysis on rows that have no tweet, so we removed those 33 rows. Also, we want to remove the rows that have NA for both “positive” and “negative” sentiments. Having NA for those sentiments mean that the tweet doesn’t contain any information to calculate sentiment score, so we removed those rows. In addition, for sentiment columns - joy, trust, anticipation, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust, positive, negative - we replaced all NAs with 0s because NA in those columns means that the tweet didn’t contain any word that pertains to those sentiments. Having 0s in place of NAs will ensure that all the sentiment columns have valid number entries for the graphs in Ch.5 and 6 to use. After we dealt with all the missing values, we ended up getting the dataset that has no NA. Because we replaced all NAs that were in the sentiments columns to 0, we have the above graph that has no missing values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Data Exploration 5.2 What were the sentimental reactions of different groups to Covid-19 news? 5.3 Deep Dive into Reactions of Politicians:", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Data Exploration Before diving into the sentiment analysis, we wanted to visualize some of the key metrics, namely the number tweets and the number of followers, to better understand the data we are working with, check the validity of data, and think about how they may impact the result of our analysis. As aforementioned in previous sections, the groups we are interested in exploring are celebrities, medical, and politicians, and we will be exploring the tweets posted by the most popular ten accounts from each group, dating from March 2020 to November 2021. 5.1.1 The Number of Covid-19-related Tweets for Different Groups Key observations and insights are as follows: The number of tweets are low in 2020 Q1 because there are far less data represented in this period. The earliest data collected is from March 2020, and therefore our data do not include Jan-Feb 2020 tweets. We can observe that the number of tweets posted by the medical group was relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic but started increasing rapidly and far exceeded the number of posts by the rest groups as time went on. This seems reasonable since the medical may not have had enough valid information to share with the public at first but may have ascertained more information about Covid-19 with time that can be shared with the public. We acknowledge that the number of tweets by medical spiked since 2021 Q3. We cannot identify the exact cause. However, we do not believe that this would negatively impact our analysis. Also, the data imbalance between group is not a significant issue in our analysis since the sentiment of each group’s tweet is calculated on its own. 5.1.2 The Number of Followers for Different Groups We also wanted to look at the number of followers by each group. The number of followers is similar between politicians and medical, but celebrities’ followers are far fewer. This may represent that the degree of influence is different for each group. However, we do not foresee this as a significant issue for our analysis since our analysis focuses on the sentimental reactions of those groups rather than the influence of those groups. 5.2 What were the sentimental reactions of different groups to Covid-19 news? In this subsection, we dive into sentiment analysis and visualization. The main purpose is to compare the sentimental reactions among different groups and analyze the changes across time. 5.2.1 The Change of Sentiments (Positive/Negative) for Different Groups As part of the sentiment analysis, we first visualized the change in sentiments over time for each group. Score above 0 is generally associated with positive sentiment and below 0 with negative sentiment. Score 1 and -1 are the most extreme values for positive and negative sentiment, respectively. We can observe that the scores for posts by all groups are generally above 0 over the timeline of our analysis which indicates that tweets posted leaned to be positive on average. However, since we are looking at average scores, we cannot conclude that all posts were positive. To investigate this further, we will look at more visualizations below to expand the positive/negative sentiment into more detailed categories. Key observations and insights from this graph are as follows: It is noteworthy that the sentiment score of celebrities generally move in the same direction as the medical’s while politicians’ score move in the opposite direction of the medical’s. As was pointed out in section 5.2.1, celebrities’ most dominant sentiment is positive. Although medical’s and politicians’ sentiment seem to be fluctuating quite a bit because the graph looks that way, but as will be shown in section 5.2.3, the change is not dramatic. If we take into account the actual score values, we can observe that the values only fluctuate between 0.1 and 0.4. Below, we will introduce more granular levels of sentiments instead of using binary levels – either positive or negative. 5.2.2 More Granular Levels of Sentiments We introduced a third sentiment “neutral” and created an overall sentiment mosaic graph. In this view, we can look at the proportional breakdown of sentiment scores and compare the proportions among groups instead of looking at the changes across time. Key observations and insights are as follows: As we noted in the data exploration section, the number of tweets posted by medical is significantly larger than the others’. Therefore, the medical group takes the majority of the space in the mosaic plot. To our surprise, the celebrities’ sentiment is not as positive as depicted in the section 5.2.1. Rather than having a large positive score, it was the small negative score that propped up celebrities’ sentiment score that made their score look the most positive. In section 5.2.1., the sentiments of politicians and medical seemed to be moving in the opposite directions across time. However, their overall score from this graph is similar (although Medical has slightly higher proportion for positive). Below, we will further divide up the sentiments to more granular levels. 5.2.3 Even More Granular Levels of Sentiments We introduce eight levels of sentiments: “joy”, “trust”, “anticipation”, “sadness”, “fear”, “anger”, “surprise”, and “disgust”. We created a stacked barplot to show the change of sentiment across time for each group. Each bar sums up to 1 and consists of the proportions of eight sentiments. Key observations and insights are as follows: Medical’s sentiment proportions do not change much across time relative to other groups’. This means that medical’s tweets did not convey any dramatic changes in sentiments over time. Sentiments like “anticipation”, “fear”, and “trust” comprise the biggest portions. It is notable that “fear” takes up as much portion as “trust” unlike in other groups’ graphs, in which “fear” is not as big as “trust”. Celebrities’ sentiments change the most in relative to other groups’. This is consistent with the findings in section 5.2.1 that celebrities’ sentiments fluctuate most dramatically. However, unlike for medical, “fear” is not the most noticable sentiment level for celebrities. This is consistent with the findings in section 5.2.2 that the negative sentiment is relatively low for celebrities. Sentiments like “joy”, “anticipation”, and “trust” seem to be most dominent setiment levels. The most dominant sentiment level for politicians seems to be “trust” across time. Politicians were more “suprised” at the beginning of the outbreak as can be seen in the bigger purple box in 2020 Q1. But as time goes on, “surprise” takes up less portion relative to other sentiments. We noticed that the stacked barplot, while useful in observing the changes in sentiment proportions across time for each group, is not ideal for tracking the sentiments changes of specific persons across time. Therefore, we resorted to an alluvial plot to better understand and track how individuals’ sentiments change over time. 5.2.4 Tracking Sentimental Reaction Change In lieu of creating an alluvia for every single tweet, we grouped the tweets by user accounts for each quarter, and we take the mean of scores for each sentiment categories. Then, we chose the most dominant sentiment category for each user who belong to one of the three groups, celebrities, medical, and politicians. As a result, some of the sentiment categories with low frequencies, such as anger, are not represented in the graph. These are the details we compromised to achieve a clearer big picture. We can clearly track changes of sentiments for each user from their respective group. Most users that pass through or arrive at the “fear” strata belong to medical, especially in 2021 Q4. Also, most medical users end up feeling “fear”. We also observed that the proportion of “fear” is relatively large in medical group in section 5.2.3, and it is more noticeable through the alluvial plot. Furthermore, the number of users whose dominant sentiment is “fear” keeps increasing over time, though we expected that “fear” would decrease with the help of vaccines for COVID-19 and decreasing trend of positive cases. Politicians’ most dominant sentiment is “trust” as we expected. And there are only few individuals who change their dominant sentiment over the time. In contrast, celebrities’ dominant sentiments keep changing from “fear” to “joy” to “sadness”. The number of users that tweets about COVID-19 is increasing over time as COVID-19 is spreading. That is reflected on the height of axis for each quarter. Also, the number of medical users who tweet about COVID-19 increases as time goes by. 5.3 Deep Dive into Reactions of Politicians: We wanted to take a look at whether politicians’ sentimental reactions would depend on their political stance. In other words, would the Republican party members react differently to the same news than Democratic party members would? In order to answer this question, we labelled each of the 10 politicians according to their associated political parties – all were part of either Republican or Democratic party. 5.3.1 Transition of Sentiments for Different Political Parties The graph above shows the average sentiment score across time for Republican and Democratic politicians, respectively. The dotted lines and the comments (in teal) indicate some of the key events that are noteworthy. The key events were extracted from the CDC website: https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html. Key observations and insights are as follows: Our initial hypothesis was that the two parties’ reactions would move in opposite directions. However, their reactions generally move in the same direction although the magnitude of the sentiment score differs between two parties. The data and graph do not support that politicians from different parties react in opposite directions. It is interesting to note that some of the key events do not drastically change the sentimental reactions. For instance, event (1) and (3) are respectively negative and positive events that one would assume to be significant enough to influence the sentimental reaction and change their directions. However, the general direction of the sentiment remained the same after both events. Perhaps, some events take some time to start steering the direction of the sentiments. For instance, it took a couple of months after event (3) for sentiment scores to start increasing. Event (2) seems to have changed the course of sentimental reaction. However, given that the change happened in delay (about a couple of months later after event (2)), the change may not be directly related to event (2). "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Sentiment Score Transition for Different Groups Select Group from the Dropdown List! On this chapter, we made an interactive graph where you can see the difference of sentiment score transitions among different groups of people. Our goal of this project is to see how different groups of people react against the same news topic, here COVID-19. By making this graph interactive, the graph dynamically illustrates the difference between two sentiment lines, which enables us to observe the difference more intuitively than the static graph in the section 5.2.1. Using the drop-down button at top center, we can choose which group’s sentiment score graph over time to display. We smoothed the curve by using d3 library d3-regression because we observed many dates when no user tweeted about COVID-19. The graph will start by showing politicians’ sentiment score graph by default, and choosing another group from the button will transform the graph accordingly. The benefit of using this interactive graph is that we can see each group’s sentiment score changes more closely, and also, we can tell the difference between two groups by seeing how the graph transforms as we choose another group from the button. Note: We made two csv files for interactive graph. Both csv contain four columns - date, politicians’ sentiment scores, medicals’ sentiment scores, celebrities’ sentiment scores. interactive_with_na.csv contains all dates that at least one of the groups has sentiment scores, which means there are NAs in some entries for each group. interactive_without_na.csv only contains dates that all three groups have sentiment scores. We decided to use interactive_without_na.csv because having NAs in the dataset made the interactive graph malfunction when transitioning to another group. As we can see from the graph, sentiment score of politicians move in the opposite direction of the medical’s score. One can go back and forth between the two groups’ graphs to see that the general flow of the graphs change dramatically. Though the sentiment score of celebrities generally fluctuated more than the other groups, the sentiment scores are generally higher than the others’ after COVID-19. In this way, we could observe that there are differences of reactions among different groups of people from this interactive graph.
