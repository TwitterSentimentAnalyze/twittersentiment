As aforementioned in previous sections, the groups we are interested in exploring are celebrities, medical, and politicians, and we will be exploring the tweets posted by the most popular ten accounts from each group, dating from March 2020 to November 2021. 5.1.1 The Number of Covid-19-related Tweets for Different Groups Key observations and insights are as follows: The number of tweets are low in 2020 Q1 because there are far less data represented in this period. The earliest data collected is from March 2020, and therefore our data do not include Jan-Feb 2020 tweets. We can observe that the number of tweets posted by the medical group was relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic but started increasing rapidly and far exceeded the number of posts by the rest groups as time went on. This seems reasonable since the medical may not have had enough valid information to share with the public at first but may have ascertained more information about Covid-19 with time that can be shared with the public. We acknowledge that the number of tweets by medical spiked since 2021 Q3. We cannot identify the exact cause. However, we do not believe that this would negatively impact our analysis. Also, the data imbalance between group is not a significant issue in our analysis since the sentiment of each groups tweet is calculated on its own. 5.1.2 The Number of Followers for Different Groups We also wanted to look at the number of followers by each group. The number of followers is similar between politicians and medical, but celebrities followers are far fewer. This may represent that the degree of influence is different for each group. However, we do not foresee this as a significant issue for our analysis since our analysis focuses on the sentimental reactions of those groups rather than the influence of those groups. 5.2 What were the sentimental reactions of different groups to Covid-19 news? In this subsection, we dive into sentiment analysis and visualization. The main purpose is to compare the sentimental reactions among different groups and analyze the changes across time. 5.2.1 The Change of Sentiments (Positive/Negative) for Different Groups As part of the sentiment analysis, we first visualized the change in sentiments over time for each group. Score above 0 is generally associated with positive sentiment and below 0 with negative sentiment. Score 1 and -1 are the most extreme values for positive and negative sentiment, respectively. We can observe that the scores for posts by all groups are generally above 0 over the timeline of our analysis which indicates that tweets posted leaned to be positive on average. However, since we are looking at average scores, we cannot conclude that all posts were positive. To investigate this further, we will look at more visualizations below to expand the positive/negative sentiment into more detailed categories. Key observations and insights from this graph are as follows: It is noteworthy that the sentiment score of celebrities generally move in the same direction as the medicals while politicians score move in the opposite direction of the medicals. As was pointed out in section 5.2.1, celebrities most dominant sentiment is positive. Although medicals and politicians sentiment seem to be fluctuating quite a bit because the graph looks that way, but as will be shown in section 5.2.3, the change is not dramatic. If we take into account the actual score values, we can observe that the values only fluctuate between 0.1 and 0.4. Below, we will introduce more granular levels of sentiments instead of using binary levels  either positive or negative. 5.2.2 More Granular Levels of Sentiments We introduced a third sentiment neutral and created an overall sentiment mosaic graph. In this view, we can look at the proportional breakdown of sentiment scores and compare the proportions among groups instead of looking at the changes across time. Key observations and insights are as follows: As we noted in the data exploration section, the number of tweets posted by medical is significantly larger than the others. Therefore, the medical group takes the majority of the space in the mosaic plot. To our surprise, the celebrities sentiment is not as positive as depicted in the section 5.2.1. Rather than having a large positive score, it was the small negative score that propped up celebrities sentiment score that made their score look the most positive. In section 5.2.1., the sentiments of politicians and medical seemed to be moving in the opposite directions across time. However, their overall score from this graph is similar (although Medical has slightly higher proportion for positive). Below, we will further divide up the sentiments to more granular levels. 5.2.3 Even More Granular Levels of Sentiments We introduce eight levels of sentiments: joy, trust, anticipation, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust. We created a stacked barplot to show the change of sentiment across time for each group. Each bar sums up to 1 and consists of the proportions of eight sentiments. Key observations and insights are as follows: Medicals sentiment proportions do not change much across time relative to other groups. This means that medicals tweets did not convey any dramatic changes in sentiments over time. Sentiments like anticipation, fear, and trust comprise the biggest portions. It is notable that fear takes up as much portion as trust unlike in other groups graphs, in which fear is not as big as trust. Celebrities sentiments change the most in relative to other groups. This is consistent with the findings in section 5.2.1 that celebrities sentiments fluctuate most dramatically. However, unlike for medical, fear is not the most noticable sentiment level for celebrities. This is consistent with the findings in section 5.2.2 that the negative sentiment is relatively low for celebrities. Sentiments like joy, anticipation, and trust seem to be most dominent setiment levels. The most dominant sentiment level for politicians seems to be trust across time. Politicians were more suprised at the beginning of the outbreak as can be seen in the bigger purple box in 2020 Q1. But as time goes on, surprise takes up less portion relative to other sentiments. We noticed that the stacked barplot, while useful in observing the changes in sentiment proportions across time for each group, is not ideal for tracking the sentiments changes of specific persons across time. Therefore, we resorted to an alluvial plot to better understand and track how individuals sentiments change over time. 5.2.4 Tracking Sentimental Reaction Change In lieu of creating an alluvia for every single tweet, we grouped the tweets by user accounts for each quarter, and we take the mean of scores for each sentiment categories. Then, we chose the most dominant sentiment category for each user who belong to one of the three groups, celebrities, medical, and politicians. As a result, some of the sentiment categories with low frequencies, such as anger, are not represented in the graph. These are the details we compromised to achieve a clearer big picture. We can clearly track changes of sentiments for each user from their respective group. Most users that pass through or arrive at the fear strata belong to medical, especially in 2021 Q4. Also, most medical users end up feeling fear. We also observed that the proportion of fear is relatively large in medical group in section 5.2.3, and it is more noticeable through the alluvial plot. Furthermore, the number of users whose dominant sentiment is fear keeps increasing over time, though we expected that fear would decrease with the help of vaccines for COVID-19 and decreasing trend of positive cases. Politicians most dominant sentiment is trust as we expected. And there are only few individuals who change their dominant sentiment over the time. In contrast, celebrities dominant sentiments keep changing from fear to joy to sadness. The number of users that tweets about COVID-19 is increasing over time as COVID-19 is spreading. That is reflected on the height of axis for each quarter. Also, the number of medical users who tweet about COVID-19 increases as time goes by. 5.3 Deep Dive into Reactions of Politicians: We wanted to take a look at whether politicians sentimental reactions would depend on their political stance. In other words, would the Republican party members react differently to the same news than Democratic party members would? In order to answer this question, we labelled each of the 10 politicians according to their associated political parties  all were part of either Republican or Democratic party. 5.3.1 Transition of Sentiments for Different Political Parties The graph above shows the average sentiment score across time for Republican and Democratic politicians, respectively. The dotted lines and the comments (in teal) indicate some of the key events that are noteworthy. The key events were extracted from the CDC website: https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html. Key observations and insights are as follows: Our initial hypothesis was that the two parties reactions would move in opposite directions. However, their reactions generally move in the same direction although the magnitude of the sentiment score differs between two parties. The data and graph do not support that politicians from different parties react in opposite directions. It is interesting to note that some of the key events do not drastically change the sentimental reactions. For instance, event (1) and (3) are respectively negative and positive events that one would assume to be significant enough to influence the sentimental reaction and change their directions. However, the general direction of the sentiment remained the same after both events. Perhaps, some events take some time to start steering the direction of the sentiments. For instance, it took a couple of months after event (3) for sentiment scores to start increasing. Event (2) seems to have changed the course of sentimental reaction. However, given that the change happened in delay (about a couple of months later after event (2)), the change may not be directly related to event (2).
